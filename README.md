# Display Control Manager 

## Description
This project provides a software solution for managing digital display systems. The application enables configuration, control, and monitoring of displays using a custom communication protocol.

## Key Features
1. **Message Construction**: Generates messages in a standardized binary format for communication with displays.
2. **Message Transmission**: Uses an asynchronous TCP client to send messages to display devices.
3. **Data Integrity Validation**: Implements checksum calculations to ensure message integrity.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive graphical interface for configuring and controlling displays.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C#.
- **Platform**: .NET 6.
- **Graphical Interface**: Windows Forms.
- **Communication Protocol**: TCP/IP.
- **Message Structure**: Custom binary format.

## Technical Details (Abstracted)

### Message Construction
Messages are built according to a custom protocol and include:
- Display identification.
- Command codes.
- Specific parameters such as displayed text or brightness settings.

### Message Validation
A checksum algorithm is used to ensure the integrity of the transmitted messages.

### Message Transmission
Messages are sent to displays via a secure and asynchronous TCP connection, with real-time processing of responses.

## Feature Examples
### Message Creation
Messages include information such as commands, necessary data, and an integrity verification checksum. The exact structure is implemented according to confidential specifications.

### Sending Messages
The application uses a TCP client to send constructed messages to displays and receives responses such as device status or command execution results.
